# A software and learning framework for a self-hosted open-source AI assisted literature review, based on — open access, global equity, and open science

2nd July 2025

### Links and contact

LLM RAG GitHub repository (version for working with IPCC reports): [https://github.com/semanticClimate/llmrag](https://github.com/semanticClimate/llmrag)

### Mission

The mission is to build a self-hosted open-source AI LLM RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assisted literature review system with supporting user learning material. The system is for: using open access literature repositories; is based on open science (open scholarship) principles; is globally equitable, inclusive, and multilingual, and; is independent of commercial providers.

### Objectives and values

1. To create an AI LLM RAG self-hosted platform and infrastructure framework for  literature retrieval and knowledge query.  
2. Provide supporting learning resources for AI LLM RAG conceptual models and methods using ‘learning-and-understanding-by-doing’ — its parts and how it impacts the information landscape.  
3. The system and its supporting learning material is designed so that newcomers can enable competences, help understand the principles involved, and how it impacts the information landscape.  
4. An approach that implements Global South knowledge participation parity (KPP)\*, is global in scope and multilingual.  
5. To use only open access literature and FAIR data source for AI LLM use.  
6. How to manage and use your own open-source AI LLM platform and infrastructure that is: accessible to all, is designed for digital sovereignty, and is fully open science based from the start, as uses — open source software, and creates FAIR data outputs.  
7. To create data sets, such as vector databases, of your own that are fully open source, open licenced, open science in all aspects — including FAIR data.  
8. Create a Git based template and methodology for working with AI LLMs. The template allows different technologies to be interchanged or for use in different application use cases — chatbots, for research, literature reviews, text search, derivative publishing, etc.  
9. The technical architecture can run on the command line, in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab, and as a Streamlit software UI. It acts as a complete pipeline system that goes from raw-text to knowledge and query.  
10. To enable the understanding of what are the components needed for an AI LLM system.  
11. The system is designed for working with and creating text corpora.  
12. Aware of climate change impact issues.

\*Analogous to the economics framework of purchasing power parity (PPP) which is used for setting regional pricing of products. For PPP indices see: [Eurostat data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=670267). PPPs convert different currencies into a common unit which equalizes their purchasing power and eliminates differences in price levels between economies.

### How to implement the objectives and values

Open

* Open source software licencing  
* Open science compliant in all areas and values  
* FAIR data principles for data use and data production, e.g., in data production, vector databases  
* AI LLM is open source (where possible)  
* AI LLM restrictions on republishing content or using content in training? (where possible and if needed)  
* Full documentation for reproducibility (where possible)  
* Research is open science and open notebook science based from the start  
* AI regulation compliant  
* Digital sovereignty by design

Open access

* Use open access research literature repositories:  
  * Redalyc  
  * OpenAlex  
  * Europe PubMed Central (Europe PMC)  
  * bioRxiv  
  * Ukrainian OA repository  
  * etc.

Global

* AI and LLM without geo blocking  
* Multilingual supporting AI LLM  
* Open science knowledge equity values followed — UN Open Science Recommendations

### Value proposition

* Support trust in users  
* Avoid vendor lockin  
* Aim to have higher quality best of class literature and data retrieval results  
* Enable transparency and reproducibility as much as possible  
* Institutional knowledge retention  
* Support the knowledge commons and biblio-diversity
