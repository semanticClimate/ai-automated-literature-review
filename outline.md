# Documentation Outline

The idea is to create descriptions of what we would like the ALR to do.

The writing style will be based on the following:

The guide will be considered a Step-by-step guide acording to the Diátaxis method as the audience will be users familiar with data science tooling and paper writing (as Diátaxis describes it - a work place instruction).

 - Technical writing method: Diátaxis - https://diataxis.fr/
 - Technical writing style: MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide
 - Style guide: APA - https://apastyle.apa.org/

The writing tooling has not yet been selected.

**Questions:** 

How does the author report on their question in the literature review in terms of the use of ALR?

**Notes:** 

**Outline:**
Outline for Reporting on the Research Question in the Literature Review Using pygetpapers :

**Introduction:**

1. Introduce the research question and its significance.
2. Provide background information on the topic.
3. Explain the relevance of Automated Literature Review (ALR) tools like pygetpapers.
4. State the purpose of the literature review and its organization.

**Methodology for Literature Search:**

1. Describe the methodology used to conduct the literature search.
2. Explain the use of pygetpapers for automating the retrieval of academic papers.
3. Specify the search strategy, including keywords, phrases, and Boolean operators.
4. Detail the sources from which papers were retrieved (e.g., Europe PMC).

**Selection Criteria and Filtering:**

1. Define the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to filter the search results.
2. Discuss the process of filtering papers based on relevance and quality.
3. Highlight any manual or programmatic filtering techniques employed.

**Organization and Categorization:**

1. Explain how the retrieved literature was organized and categorized.
2. Discuss the criteria used for categorization, such as themes, methodologies, or findings.
3. Provide insights into the structure of the literature review based on these categories.

**Synthesis of Findings:**

1. Summarize the main findings from the retrieved literature.
2. Discuss common themes, trends, and patterns identified in the literature.
3. Highlight any contradictions or inconsistencies among the findings.

**Critical Analysis and Quality Assessment:**

1. Conduct a critical analysis of the methodologies employed in the retrieved studies.
2. Assess the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the findings.
3. Utilize metrics such as citation counts or impact factors to evaluate the quality of the literature.

**Conclusion:**

1. Summarize the key findings and insights from the literature review.
2. Reiterate the significance of the research question and its implications for the field.
3. Reflect on the role of ALR tools like pygetpapers in facilitating the literature review process.

## Using collection in your review paper

Assigned [@Simon Worthington](https://github.com/mrchristian) -

**Notes:** 

The author needs to use the collection, and information and data about the collection in their literature review paper. 

**Questions:** 

What does the collection (or what would we like it to collect) and the process produce that the author can use in their paper?

 - A complete Git repository
 - A replicable and reusable system
 - A DOI references data and code set on Zenodo or other academic repository as a full GitHub repository using Software Citation
 - A saved query: https://pygetpapers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_documentation.html#example-query Flag --save_query as saved_config.ini
 - A CProject for the whole query
 - A CTree per paper
 - Custom terms and dictionaries
 - Data analysis results?
  - Hits
  - Word frequency
 - Bibtex output and import with content an/or contnet links to Zotero
 - CSS Paged media outputs

**Outline:**

 - Add reference list to the paper and store it in Zotero
 - Take a GitHub Release of repository add to Zenodo and link as data to paper
 - Link to all papers in repo CTree
 - Present question and methods for converting into query, show table of queries, link to data
 - Provide information on how to reproduce and reuse / extend the CProject
 - Present data analysis of literature review in paper
  - Chart and data link to number of hits
  - Chart of NGram of search term
  - Table of work frequency
  - Table of top ten papers
  - Table of top journals, top authors
