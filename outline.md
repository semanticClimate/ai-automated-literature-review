# Documentation Outline

The idea is to create descriptions of what we would like the ALR to do.

The writing style will be based on the following:

The guide will be considered a Step-by-step guide acording to the Diátaxis method as the audience will be users familiar with data science tooling and paper writing (as Diátaxis describes it - a work place instruction).

 - Technical writing method: Diátaxis - https://diataxis.fr/
 - Technical writing style: MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide
 - Style guide: APA - https://apastyle.apa.org/

The writing tooling has not yet been selected.

## Using the literature collection in your review paper

Assigned [@Simon Worthington](https://github.com/mrchristian) -

**Notes:** 

The author needs to use the collection, and information and data about the collection in their literature review paper. 

**Questions:** 

What does the collection (or what would we like it to collect) and the process produce that the author can use in their paper?

 - A complete Git repository
 - A replicable and reusable system
 - A DOI references data and code set on Zenodo or other academic repository as a full GitHub repository using Software Citation
 - A saved query: https://pygetpapers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_documentation.html#example-query Flag --save_query as saved_config.ini
 - A CProject for the whole query
 - A CTree per paper
 - Custom terms and dictionaries
 - Data analysis results?
  - Hits
  - Word frequency
 - Bibtex output and import with content an/or contnet links to Zotero
 - CSS Paged media outputs

**Outline:**

 - Add reference list to the paper and store it in Zotero
 - Take a GitHub Release of repository add to Zenodo and link as data to paper
 - Link to all papers in repo CTree
 - Present question and methods for converting into query, show table of queries, link to data
 - Provide information on how to reproduce and reuse / extend the CProject
 - Present data analysis of literature review in paper
  - Chart and data link to number of hits
  - Chart of NGram of search term
  - Table of work frequency
  - Table of top ten papers
  - Table of top journals, top authors
