# Documentation Outline

The idea is to create descriptions of what we would like the ALR to do.

The writing style will be based on the following:

  - Technical writing method: Di√°taxis - https://diataxis.fr/
  - Technical writing style: MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide
  - Style guide: APA - https://apastyle.apa.org/

The writing tooling has not yet been selected.

## About: Orientation and learning points

## A literature review question?

Assigned @neerajkumaris - 

Questions: 

How does the author report on their question in the literature review in terms of the use of ALR?

## Searching open corpora

## Analysing your collection

## Using collection in your review paper

Notes: 

The author needs to use the collection, and information and data about the collection in their literature review paper. 

Questions:

What does the collection (or what would we like it to collect) and the process produce that the author can use in their paper?

  - A complete Git repository
  - A replicable and reusable system
  - A DOI references data and code set on Zenodo or other academic repository as a full GitHub repository using Software Citation
  - A saved query: https://pygetpapers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_documentation.html#example-query Flag --save_query as saved_config.ini
  - A CProject for the whole query
  - A CTree per paper
  - Custom terms and dictionaries
  - Data analysis results?
    - Hits
    - Word frequency
