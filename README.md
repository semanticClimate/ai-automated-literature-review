## Abstract

The course covers how to use a self-hosted open-source AI LLM RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assisted literature review system with supporting user learning material. The system is for: using open access literature repositories; is based on open science (open scholarship) principles; is globally equitable, inclusive, and multilingual, and; is independent of commercial providers.

Participants will be able to self-host their own open-source AI LLM RAG system with no dependency on commercial providers, and to be able to adapt the system to different retrieval and knowledge query use cases. See: [semanticClimate llmrag repo](https://github.com/semanticClimate/llmrag) | [About #sC llmrage](open source ai llm.md)

The Assisted Literature Review (ALR) course covers instruction for a semi-automated literature search with a focus on AI LLM RAG use on a dedicated corpus. In the course the example corpus will be the IPCC’s *Sixth Assessment Report*. The framework can be used on any topic or corpus, for example from the Open Access literature from Europe PMC, which is a corpus of 7 million open access articles.

The AI and machine learning open-source software used is the \#semanticClimate text and data mining tooling. The course is an introduction to AI Algorithms for data mining including LLM RAG frameworks. A template ‘good practice’ framework will be provided for participants later use.This course introduces literature search, text mining, image classification as well as object detection. The algorithms and the data used are all open-source and issues of trustability for open science are a priority.

All instruction is carried out using CoLab Jupyter Notebooks so no complicated installations are required.

The learning points covered allow for familiarity with AI tooling for literature search and as a package that can be reused by students and researchers. The learning package already exists as a fully documented workflow, with existing CoLab Notebooks — all deposited in Zenodo with DOIs. The intention is to give participants experience and methodologies to evaluate and integrate AI LLM RAG into their workflows. AI is evolving so fast that focusing on one set of fixed components in a tech stack is not possible, instead the focus is on concept and evaluation.

Course units are:

* Designing your AI LLM RAG assisted literature review and good practice;  
* Named entity recognition;  
* Summarisation;  
* Corpus creation, and text and data mining;  
* Image classification;  
* LLM RAG use with PDFs and with HTML.

The focus for the class is a scoping literature review. The results of the AI Assisted Literature Review workflow taught in the class are a literature review report, including: a textual summary, summaries of papers as a data table, the complete full-text articles downloaded, a reproducible and replicable CoLab Notebook with all the software and code used in the review. The resulting content package can be used in papers, reporting, dashboards, CI pipelines, and for further data analysis.

**Audience:** Researchers, librarians, publishers

Level: (Beginner, but suitable for all levels)

**Requirements:** Run Google ColLab in a browser. See: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) A Google account to run CoLab Jupyter Notebooks (if this is not possible users can run Notebooks in their own environments \- but please check with course organisers for support). Have a GitLab account (other Git versions can be used \- GitLab or Codeberg, etc. Contact course organisers in advance if this is required.)

## Course Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, participants will be able to:

* Conduct a scoping literature review using AI LLM RAG tooling  
* Obtain familiarity with using LLM RAG with PDFs and with HTML  
* Be able to carry out text and data mining and build a corpus from open access sources such as EPMC  
* Use CoLab Jupyter Notebooks, execute python commands, and use GitHub.  
* Use the provided ‘good practice’ framework for managing LLM projects

## Course Topics

This course will be presented over three days for 1 hours each day and will cover these  topics:

* Understanding of AI LLM RAG key components  
* Use of provided LLM RAG system to design own project  
* Corpus creation, and text and data mining;  
* Named entity recognition;  
* Summarisation;  
* Image classification;  
* LLM RAG use with PDFs and with HTML
